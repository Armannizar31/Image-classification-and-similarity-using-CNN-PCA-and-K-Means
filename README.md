# Image-classification-and-similarity-using-CNN-PCA-and-K-Means
Having a picture of product and want to get the very same product, but searching for it can be a real problem. Searching keywords can make our process slightly less problematic but looking each and every product to find the very same or similar product can cause you go through many pages. For this purpose, we proposed image searching, you can upload the picture of the product you want and our model will provide you the very same product if available and some similar products. To accomplish our proposed solution, we will be implementing deep learningâ€™s convolutional neural networks(CNN) for image classification and to find the similar images/products we will implement K-means and to transform the data we will use principal component analysis(PCA).
